## issues
I couldn't find the way to use APIs without uploading API keys to github repository.
So, I use APIs not using API keys.
There are some issues at APIs

### 1. Background Image
There are rate limit on unsplash API. So maybe you can't background images.
And it's very slow to get a image from server. You need to wait for it.

### 2. Weather Info
Sometimes API sends strange location's weather information. It's not my fault. I send latitude and longitude information to the server.
So you need to understand this situation.
